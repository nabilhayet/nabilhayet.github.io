The name of my first project is Movies world. While working on this project i learnt how to use new technology like ruby. I also found how ruby gems or libraries like 'open-uri' and 'nokogiri' can make a project more interesting! Not only i figured out how to set up the dependencies of a project but also what is the relationship between those files. I am very thankful to my mentor who helped me in this project. Scrapping is a topic which i wasn't too much familiar with before start working on the project. At the end, after finishing this project, i am feeling more confident than before.
