From my cholhood i had a wish to have some impact on people life.I wanted to put impact by doing something great for the society. But i wasn't sure how to start! Then when i looked at the software engineers,i found out how they have changed the world by their invention.It feels amazing when i see people ordering some items from online sitting at home rather than going to the store! The value and greateness of a software engineer has pushed to cherish my dreams.
